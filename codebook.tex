\#\#The run\_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then
followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's
definition.

\#Download the dataset \#Dataset downloaded and extracted under the
folder called UCI HAR Dataset

\#\#Assign each data to variables \#\#features \textless- features.txt :
561 rows, 2 columns \#\#The features selected for this database come
from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and
tGyro-XYZ. \#\#activities \textless- activity\_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2
columns \#\#List of activities performed when the corresponding
measurements were taken and its codes (labels) \#\#subject\_test
\textless- test/subject\_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column \#\#contains
test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed \#\#x\_test
\textless- test/X\_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns \#\#contains
recorded features test data \#\#y\_test \textless- test/y\_test.txt :
2947 rows, 1 columns \#\#contains test data of activities'code labels
\#\#subject\_train \textless- test/subject\_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1
column \#\#contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being
observed \#\#x\_train \textless- test/X\_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561
columns \#\#contains recorded features train data \#\#y\_train
\textless- test/y\_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns \#\#contains train
data of activities'code labels

\#\#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set \#\#X
(10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x\_train and x\_test
using rbind() function \#\#Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by
merging y\_train and y\_test using rbind() function \#\#Subject (10299
rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject\_train and subject\_test
using rbind() function \#\#Merged\_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is
created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

\#\#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
for each measurement \#\#TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by
subsetting Merged\_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the
measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each
measurement

\#\#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
set \#\#Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with
corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities
variable

\#\#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
\#\#code column in TidyData renamed into activities \#\#All Acc in
column's name replaced by Accelerometer \#\#All Gyro in column's name
replaced by Gyroscope \#\#All BodyBody in column's name replaced by Body
\#\#All Mag in column's name replaced by Magnitude \#\#All start with
character f in column's name replaced by Frequency \#\#All start with
character t in column's name replaced by Time

\#\#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
\#\#FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData
taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject,
after groupped by subject and activity. \#\#Export FinalData into
FinalData.txt file.
